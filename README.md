# MINLPTests.jl
This is a collection of JuMP models for testing nonlinear/polynomial solvers with and without discrete variables in JuMP.


## Test Design Guidelines

* Unit tests should be "easy" models, it should be possible for a non-global solver to find the global solution
* Mathmatical property tests can be more difficult


## Test Naming Conventions
